### Hi there, welcome to my github ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ronan Byrne and I am from Dublin, Ireland. I am an experienced software developer (Java / Spring) having spent over a year at Citi Bank, Dublin.  

In late 2020 I graduated with a First Class Honours Degree form an MSc in Computer Science from University College Dublin (UCD). As part of my time studying I worked on some exciting projects, some of which can be seen below. For example, I am particularly proud of my thesis project, DublinBus. Since graduating I have been working as a Backend Engineer (Java / Spring) with Citi Bank, Dublin.

The technologies that can be seen on the projects displayed on this profile include:

- Backend development using Java with Spring (Spring Code Resuse) and Python with both Django (DublinBus, ShelfSense) and Flask (CycleBerry)
- Frontend Development in HTML, CSS and Javascript with and without external libraries (DublinBus, CycleBerry, ShelfSense)
- Database administration with MySQL (DublinBus, CycleBerry) and MongoDB (Spring Code Resuse)
- Machine Learning through Python using Sci-Kit Learn (AlgorithmBias)
- Test driven development (TDD) and a focus on scalability
