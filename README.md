### Hi there, welcome to my github ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ronan Byrne and I am from Dublin, Ireland. I recently graduated with an MSc in Computer Science from University College Dublin (UCD). This profile should highlight some of the exciting things that I worked on whilst studying. For example, I am particularly proud of my thesis project, DublinBus. 

The technologies that can be seen on the projects displayed on this profile include:

- Backend development using Python with both Django (DublinBus, ShelfSense and Flask (CycleBerry)
- Frontend Development in HTML, CSS and Javascript with and without external libraries
- Database administration with MySQL
- Machine Learning through Python using Sci-Kit Learn

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and hope to get some projects up and running in the near future
