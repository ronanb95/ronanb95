### Hi there, welcome to my github ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ronan Byrne and I am from Dublin, Ireland. I recently graduated with an MSc in Computer Science from University College Dublin (UCD). This profile should highlight some of the exciting things that I worked on whilst studying. For example, I am particularly proud of my thesis project, DublinBus.
